uci bank marketing dataset
Problem statement: 
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. 
Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Business understanding

A Term Deposit is a deposit held at a financial institution that has a fixed term. These are generally short-term with maturities ranging anywhere from a month to a few years. When a term deposit is purchased, the lender (the customer) understands that the 
money can only be withdrawn after the term has ended or by giving a predetermined number of days notice. Term deposits are an extremely safe investment and are therefore very appealing to conservative, low-risk investors. 
Instead of mass marketing, the bank has chosen to be more proactive in identifying potential buyers and communicate straight to the customer via telephone calls.  Direct marketing is useful here because its positive results can be measured directly. 
The goal of this project is to perform post-campaign analytics to identify the potential subscribers of the term deposit product for future campaigns. 


The data mining task is to create a Classification Model that is able to identify potential subscribers using mainly two types of variables in the dataset: 
❏ client data (age, education, marital status, loan status, etc.)
❏ campaign contact information for the client (last contact, preferred contact etc.)


Output variable (desired target): 
y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes', 'no')
